# Portfolio-website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a web developer and mechanical engineer. The website serves as a digital representation of my professional journey and abilities, highlighting my expertise in both front-end and back-end development.

The design is clean and modern, focusing on user experience and responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across devices. The website features interactive sections that include a detailed about me page, a portfolio section displaying my best projects, and a skills area showcasing the technologies and tools I am proficient in.
